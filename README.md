[12:13:15] James007: James007 offers friendship, "Case # AU54721"
[12:14:08] James007: Hi case #AU54721
[12:56:17] PEAR: We understand who you are. Stand by a bit.
[13:14:11] James007: 👍🏼
[13:34:33] James007: Can you confirm the steps you need us to follow next?
[16:35:21] PEAR: We have breached your systems and duplicated over 6.3 TB of your data to our servers.
       
The link below contains the archive with the complete list of your files we have taken:
Archive Link - https://limewire.com/d/INc6X#vV17mBAntu
Archive Password - 23dOPMI:n{)(Mn%#
Choose for up to 3 files from the list and send us the file names. We'll send you those files back as proof of your data availability on our side.

Conditions:
 (a) You have to pay us $900,000 BTC to save your data from leaked and avoid any further damages possible;
 (b) We will provide you with our bitcoin address immediately once you confirm a deal and ready to proceed with the payment;
 (c) We set Friday, December 12th, as the deadline for the payment to be completed;
 (d) You have to be in touch with us daily within all this time. Otherwise, we will find your silence as declining a deal and will follow to harassing you, your staff, partners, and all other parties affected whose contacts on your files we have;
 (e) We will start spreading the incident and your data we have since Saturday, December 13th, if we don't get paid by that time.

What you get after we get paid:
 (a) All your data we have will be permanently removed from our servers;
 (b) You will be provided with deletion proof;

[16:35:21] PEAR:  (c) We will not ever spread a word related to this incident;
 (d) We will not ever leak, use, sell, or share with third parties even a file of your data;
 (e) We will not attack your company ever again.

[10:31:14] James007: Good morning, any suggestions?
[10:31:14] PEAR: No need sending any screenshots here.
[10:31:14] PEAR: What's your problem&
[10:31:14] PEAR: ^%&*%%$&*&
[10:31:14] PEAR: Sorry
[10:31:14] PEAR: > We are not able to open your file named AU54721_tree.txt
Why?
[10:33:25] James007: The notpade still says not responding
[16:10:48] PEAR: The tree is too big for Notepad. Set up Sublime Text and use it to open. You are wasting time.
[16:10:48] PEAR: You are sending one message a day and going offline. That is not the way to save your data from leaked. You'd better stay online and be actively communicating with us to avoid leakage. There's no other way in your shoes guys.
[16:10:48] PEAR: And one more point. You can't open the file tree is not the reason to us to extend the time frame for you. Keep in mind.
[16:13:45] James007: We are working on it

[14:51:49] James007: We got the file to open but it is loading
[14:55:43] PEAR: What's wrong with you there? It's 4th day since you are trying to open a simple text file. Are you kidding or taking us for fools???
[15:03:06] James007: We are working on it
[15:06:45] PEAR: You are working on getting closer to your data leaked. That's what you are working on.

[10:17:52] James007: Hello, so you want us to choose three files from this tree and how will you prove you have them?
